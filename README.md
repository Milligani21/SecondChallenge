# SecondChallenge
This is the second challenge for PennLPS bootcamp; To create my own portfolio and deploy it to GitHub pages. Ongoing into the future, this will house projects that I've worked on/completed as well as things that I am proud of.

The ultimate intent is that this is a showcase of my coding ability (or lack thereof) for people to take a look at.

# SecondChallenge
This is the second challenge for PennLPS bootcamp; To create my own portfolio and deploy it to GitHub pages. Ongoing into the future, this will house projects that I've worked on/completed as well as things that I am proud of.

I had some struggles bringing this page to life. Flex was tough to work with and CSS sometimes did not want to cooperate with me. I'm happy with the final product, but consider this to be a work in progress. As I continue learning, I will continue adding to this page. I would like it to eventually look like a modern website.
